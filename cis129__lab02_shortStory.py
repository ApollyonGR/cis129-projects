print("There once was a college student who wanted to be a cybersecurity major\n")
print("But uh oh! He doesn't know shit about github, or python. His only experience with coding was a singular class in 9th grade on how to make a turtle move in scratch\n")
print("But luckily, the college offered a class on programming and problem solving\n")
print("His troubles were over, he thought, and he registered for the class, ready to learn as much as he could\n")
print("BUT THEN, an EVILLLLLLL github MONSTER attacked! He wiped out the students internet connection, and all of his overwatch skins, good god! THE HORROR !\n")
